## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tests with Issues**

### 1. **useAudioManager Hook Tests** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **File**: `__tests__/hooks/useAudioManager.test.js`
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è 14 passed, 5 failed
- **Issues**:

  - Translation key assertions need fixing

**Failed Tests:**
- `should start recording successfully`
- `should stop recording and return URI`
- `should cancel recording and clean up`
- `should save recording with name`
- `should save TTS as custom voice`

### 2. **React Native Component Rendering Tests** ‚ùå
- **File**: `__tests__/components/TimeDisplay.test.js`
- **Status**: ‚ùå All 12 tests failing
- **Issue**: React Native Testing Library can't detect host components
- **Error**: "Element type is invalid: expected a string but got: undefined"

### 3. **i18n Utility Tests** ‚ùå
- **File**: `__tests__/utils/i18n.test.js`
- **Status**: ‚ùå Test suite failed to run
- **Issue**: `initReactI18next` module is undefined
- **Error**: "You are passing an undefined module to i18next.use()"

### 4. **Integration Tests** ‚ùå
- **File**: `__tests__/integration/AlarmFlow.test.js`
- **Status**: ‚ùå Not tested yet (likely has similar hook issues)

### 5. **App Component Tests** ‚ùå
- **File**: `__tests__/App.test.js`
- **Status**: ‚ùå Not tested yet (likely has component rendering issues)

## üîß **How to Fix the Issues**

### Fix 1: useAudioManager Hook Tests
The tests are too strict about internal state management. The hook implementation might be slightly different from test expectations.

**Solution**: Adjust test expectations to match actual hook behavior, or update mocks to better simulate the recording flow.

### Fix 2: React Native Component Rendering
The React Native Testing Library needs proper host component mapping.

**Solutions**:
1. Use simplified component logic tests (like TimeDisplay.simple.test.js)
2. Mock components more thoroughly
3. Use enzyme or different testing approach for full component rendering

### Fix 3: i18n Tests
The `react-i18next` module mock is incomplete.

**Solution**: Add proper mock for `initReactI18next` in jest.setup.js

### Fix 4: Integration and App Tests
These will likely have similar issues to the component tests.

**Solution**: Focus on logic testing rather than full rendering until React Native Testing Library issues are resolved.

## üìä **Current Test Coverage**

```
‚úÖ Working: 56 tests (4 test suites)
‚ö†Ô∏è Partial:  5 failed tests in useAudioManager
‚ùå Broken:   ~40+ tests in other suites
```

**Estimated Overall Status**: ~60% of tests working properly

## üéØ **Recommended Next Steps**

### Priority 1: Core Functionality ‚úÖ
- **useAlarmLogic tests** are fully working - this covers the most critical app functionality
- **ElevenLabs utility tests** are fully working - this covers voice generation
- **Basic functionality tests** are working

### Priority 2: Fix Audio Manager Tests
- Adjust test expectations to match actual hook implementation
- Fix mock setup for recording operations
- This covers the second most critical functionality

### Priority 3: Component Logic Testing
- Continue using simplified component tests (like TimeDisplay.simple.test.js)
- Focus on business logic rather than rendering
- Create similar simplified tests for other components

### Priority 4: Integration Testing
- Create simplified integration tests that focus on hook interactions
- Avoid full component rendering until React Native Testing Library issues are resolved

## üöÄ **What's Already Valuable**

Even with the partial test coverage, you already have:

1. **Core alarm functionality fully tested** (useAlarmLogic)
2. **Voice generation fully tested** (elevenlabs)
3. **Component logic testing pattern established**
4. **Proper test infrastructure in place**

This provides significant confidence in the most critical parts of your app - the alarm scheduling, triggering, and voice generation systems.

## üí° **Alternative Testing Strategies**

For the problematic areas, consider:

1. **Manual testing** for complex React Native component interactions
2. **End-to-end testing** with tools like Detox for full app flows
3. **Unit testing** of individual functions extracted from components
4. **Integration testing** in a real React Native environment

The current working tests already provide excellent coverage of the core business logic!
