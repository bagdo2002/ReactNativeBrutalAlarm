# Splash Screen Implementation Guide

## Overview
The app now includes a custom splash screen that displays before the main app loads, providing a professional and branded experience.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Native Splash Screen Configuration
- Updated `app.json` with splash screen settings
- Configured background color to match custom splash screen
- Added `expo-splash-screen` plugin configuration

### 2. Custom Splash Screen Component
- Created `components/SplashScreen.js` with animated branding
- Features smooth fade-in and scale animations
- Includes app icon with pulse animation
- Animated loading dots with staggered timing
- Professional black theme matching the "brutal" alarm concept

### 3. App Integration
- Modified `App.js` to handle splash screen lifecycle
- Prevents auto-hide of native splash screen during app loading
- Shows custom splash screen after app initialization
- Smooth transition to onboarding or main app

## Animation Timeline
1. **0-800ms**: App icon fades in and scales up
2. **800-1400ms**: App title "BRUTAL ALARM" appears
3. **1400-1900ms**: Subtitle "Wake Up. No Excuses." appears
4. **1900-3900ms**: Loading dots animation and icon pulse effect
5. **3900-4400ms**: Fade out transition

## Testing the Splash Screen

### Development Testing
1. Run `npm start` to start the development server
2. Open the app on your device/simulator
3. You should see:
   - Native splash screen briefly
   - Custom animated splash screen (4-5 seconds)
   - Smooth transition to onboarding or main app

### Production Testing
1. Build the app with `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios`
2. Install on device
3. The splash screen will show every time the app is launched

## Customization Options

### Timing Adjustments
Edit `components/SplashScreen.js`:
- Change `setTimeout` duration (currently 2000ms) for display time
- Modify animation durations for faster/slower transitions

### Visual Customization
- Update colors in the StyleSheet
- Change the app icon by replacing `assets/icon.png`
- Modify text content in the component

### Background
- Current: Black theme (#000000)
- Can be changed in both `app.json` and component styles

## Files Modified
- `App.js` - Added splash screen logic and state management
- `app.json` - Updated splash configuration and plugins
- `components/SplashScreen.js` - New custom splash screen component
- `package.json` - Added expo-splash-screen dependency

## Troubleshooting

### Splash Screen Not Showing
1. Ensure `expo-splash-screen` is installed
2. Check that `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` is called early
3. Verify app initialization is completing successfully

### Animation Issues
1. Check React Native version compatibility
2. Ensure all animations use `useNativeDriver: true`
3. Test on different devices for performance

### Build Issues
1. Run `expo prebuild` if using development builds
2. Clear cache with `expo start -c`
3. Ensure all assets exist in the specified paths
