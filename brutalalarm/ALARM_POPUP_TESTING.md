# Alarm Popup Testing Guide

## New Feature: Full-Screen Alarm Popup

Your alarm app now includes a **full-screen alarm popup** that appears when an alarm goes off, making it much easier to stop or snooze the alarm!

## What's New

âœ… **Full-screen alarm popup** - Takes over the entire screen when alarm triggers  
âœ… **Easy-to-use buttons** - Large, clear "Snooze" and "Stop Alarm" buttons  
âœ… **Vibration feedback** - Phone vibrates to get your attention  
âœ… **Audio playback** - Alarm sound plays through the popup  
âœ… **Current time display** - Shows the current time when alarm goes off  
âœ… **Works in all scenarios** - App open, background, closed, or phone locked  

## How It Works

### When Alarm Triggers:
1. **Full-screen popup appears** with dark background
2. **Alarm sound starts playing** (loops until stopped)
3. **Phone vibrates** every 2 seconds
4. **Large buttons** for easy interaction
5. **Current time** displayed prominently

### Button Actions:
- **Snooze (5min)** - Dismisses current alarm and schedules new one for 5 minutes later
- **Stop Alarm** - Completely stops the alarm and cancels all notifications

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Test with App Open
1. Set an alarm for 1-2 minutes from now
2. Keep the app open
3. When alarm time comes, the popup should appear
4. Test both "Snooze" and "Stop Alarm" buttons

### 2. Test with App in Background
1. Set an alarm for 1-2 minutes from now
2. Put app in background (press home button)
3. When alarm triggers, notification should appear
4. Tap notification to open app and show popup
5. Test the popup functionality

### 3. Test with App Closed
1. Set an alarm for 1-2 minutes from now
2. Close the app completely
3. When alarm triggers, notification should appear
4. Tap notification to open app and show popup
5. Test the popup functionality

### 4. Test with Phone Locked
1. Set an alarm for 1-2 minutes from now
2. Lock your phone
3. When alarm triggers, notification should wake screen
4. Tap notification to open app and show popup
5. Test the popup functionality

## Expected Behavior

### Popup Appearance:
- **Full-screen modal** with dark background
- **Large, readable text** in white
- **Prominent buttons** with good contrast
- **Current time** displayed in large font
- **Alarm sound name** shown as subtitle

### Audio & Vibration:
- **Alarm sound plays** immediately when popup appears
- **Sound loops** until manually stopped
- **Vibration pattern** every 2 seconds
- **Audio continues** even if phone is in silent mode

### Button Functionality:
- **Snooze button** - Blue background, schedules 5-minute delay
- **Stop button** - Red background, completely stops alarm
- **Both buttons** stop audio and vibration immediately
